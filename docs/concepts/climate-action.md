## Concept

* [[climate-action]] is the collection of actions by [[climate-actors]] to halt warming [[climate-change]] leading to [[climate-damage]].
* Only defines action which aids in fighting climate change, as opposed to [[climate-counteraction]] from the [[climate-counter-movement]]
* Will most likely stick to two categories of action: [[climate-mitigation]] and [[climate-adaptation]].

### Research questions

* What are the types of [[climate-damage]] and their causes?
* What is hindering [[climate-action]] i.e. fixes [[climate-inaction]]?

## Types of climate action

[[climate-inaction-has-political-solutions]]
[[climate-inaction-has-social-solutions]]
[[climate-inaction-has-engineering-solutions]]
[[climate-inaction-has-economic-solutions]]
[[climate-inaction-has-legal-solutions]]

## Quick notes

Might still want to define a positive/negative or hinder/help narrative on what things do. For example, for terms such as clean energy, is would be better to define energy that is climate-positive or climate-negative, which will depend on the current situation. On the other hand, gas would be [[climate-positive]] in favour of coal, but is not [[climate-optimal]], which would be the idealised version of a certain concept/term. [[climate-positive-energy]] therefore implies any improvement, while [[clean-energy]] would imply only solar and wind, and [[climate-optimal-energy]] would be nuclear fusion or a dyson sphere?
