## Scholarship

### [[gordon2004]]

[@gordon2004] states the problem for urban planners is that a "counter-regional institutional structure" is in place to solve a set of regional problems [@katz2001; @orfield2001; @orfield1998] [@gordon2004, 60]. [@gordon2004] asks the question what regional actors are in the best position to create a regional institutional structure that can make a regional planning agenda [@gordon2004, 60].
