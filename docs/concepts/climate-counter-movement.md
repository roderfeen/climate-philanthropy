[[matthew-nisbet]] notes libertarian-oriented foundations provided the [[climate-action]] counter movement with $550 million during the 2000s to oppose government regulation and help elect like-minded Republicans to Congress [@brulle2014; @mayer2016] [@nisbet2018, 4]. Conservative groups aided by Fox News managed to do [[grassroots]] organising which rallied activists to pressure senators into withdrawing support for the 2010 cap and trade bill by folding it into a narrative of doubting climate science, big government, taxes, "socialism", and "Obamacare" [@mayer2016, @skocpol2013] [@nisbet2018, 4].
