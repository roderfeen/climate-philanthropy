## Concept

### From [Wikipedia - Grassroots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots)

A grassroots movement is one that uses the people in a given district, region or community as the basis for a political or economic movement.[1] Grassroots movements and organizations use collective action from the local level to effect change at the local, regional, national or international level. Grassroots movements are associated with bottom-up, rather than top-down decision making, and are sometimes considered more natural or spontaneous than more traditional power structures.[2]

## In scholarship

[[matthew-nisbet]] notes critics have argued that the funders of the [[cea2007|Design to Win report]] acted on the misguided belief that successful [[climate-action-legislation]] is achieved through compromise agreements with industry, while in their view mobilising a public demand for [[climate-action-legislation]] through [[grassroots-organising]] was needed but overlooked [@bartosiewicz2013; @skocpol2013; @gunther2018] [@nisbet2018, 3-4].

[[matthew-nisbet]] paraphrases [@skocpol2013, 130] in saying that [[climate-action]] from philanthropists and environmentalists failed to achieve similar results to the [[climate-counter-movement]] because of their focus on [[inside-the-beltway]] strategies and a lack of [[grassroots-organising]] to include masses of citizens into the transition to a green economy [@nisbet2018, 4].
