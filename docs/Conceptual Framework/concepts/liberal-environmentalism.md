## Concept

### From [Green liberalism - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_liberalism)

Green liberalism, or liberal environmentalism,[1] is liberalism that includes green politics in its ideology. Green liberals are usually liberal on social issues and "green" on economic issues.[1] The term "green liberalism" was coined by political philosopher Marcel Wissenburg in his 1998 book Green Liberalism: The Free and The Green Society. He argues that liberalism must reject the idea of absolute property rights and accept restraints that limit the freedom to abuse nature and natural resources. However, he rejects the control of population growth [neo-malthusian, ed.] and any control over the distribution of resources as incompatible with individual liberty, instead favoring supply-side control: more efficient production and curbs on overproduction and overexploitation. This view tends to dominate the movement, although critics say it actually puts individual liberties above sustainability.[2]
