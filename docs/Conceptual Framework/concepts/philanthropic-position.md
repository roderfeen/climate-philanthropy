## Concept

What position do philanthropies hold in society? In an absolute sense, and in relation to other actors.

### Claim: Philanthropies have a unique position in society.

[@morena2020] states [[philanthropies]] have argued they 'have longer time horizons and can tolerate more risk' than politicians who focus on the next election cycle and [[CEO]]s who focus on next quarters' numbers [@polk2009] [@morena2020, 558-559].
