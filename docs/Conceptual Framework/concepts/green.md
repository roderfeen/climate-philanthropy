## Concept

The concept to overrule all other discussions on climate terminology.

The definition is positive [[climate-action]], meaning any action that has a (measurable or expected) positive effect on [[climate-change]].
This means organisations have a greenness, actions can be green or not green, there is green data and green performance data of organisations, etc.

NB: Because the term is easily highjackable and already widespread it might actually muddy the water, meaning you'd be better off (in academic writing) with positive and negative climate-action (pca, nca, p-climact, n-climact)
