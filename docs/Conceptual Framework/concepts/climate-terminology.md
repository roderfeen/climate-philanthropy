## Concept

There is a need to figure out a good way to communicate definitions and other concepts that are in line with (positive or negative) [[climate-action]].

* Climate action is positive by definition, while inaction is negative

A selection of terms that show up after a quick Google of 'sustainability' synonyms:

* Green
* Sustainable
* climate friendly
* environmental (friendly)
* ecological
* net-zero
* natural
* biological
* Renewable
* Recyclable
* Circular
* zero-waste
* low carbon-footprint
* organic
* earth-friendly

I propose to capture all these terms in the term 'green' because it is short and has the correct a-priori colloquial associations. Where specificity is required specificity will occur. Green is shorthand for any definition or concept in line with positive climate-action. In this way, sustainability performance data becomes 'greening-performance-data'. 
NB: Or maybe this muddies it even further?

Another option would be to come up with an abbreviation for positive climate-action or climate-change-mitigation-action as pca (pac?) or ccma (macc?). We are looking for terminology which describes any action in line with mitigating or adapting to climate-change, although the two are not equal nor of equal value depending on the case.

Need case:

* Data standardisation, you talk about 'sustainability-metrics', but being sustainable as in having high longevity and doing positive climate-action are not the same thing.

## Relations between concepts

## [[climate-action]], [[climate-inaction]], [[climate-threats]], [[climate-damage]]

* [[climate-action]]
  * Ideas on this have proof on e.g. [[climate-inaction-has-political-solutions]], which could be equated to [[climate-inaction-has-political-solutions]]
  * Which could then contain a note like [[climate-action-political]], which would be a list of the [[climate-action]] in the political domain.
* [[climate-threats]]
  * Ideas on this have proof on e.g. [[climate-inaction-is-a-financial-threat]]
  * Which would then also have a list of [[climate-threat-financial]]
* [[climate-damage]]
  * Ideas on this have proof that [[climate-inaction-causes-social-damage]]
  * Which would have a list of [[social-climate-damage]]

I propose these are the three categories, the first being the actual action being done, the second the sectors where [[climate-inaction]] might/will lead to [[climate-damage]], being the last category.

## History of terms I used

climate-action-is-an-*subject*-problem
climate-inaction-has-*subject*-solutions

## Quick notes and ambiguities

Possibly: [[climate-inaction-has-legal-solutions]] is writing that pushes this viewpoint or speculates on it. [[climate-action-legal]] is a list of legal climate action. [[climate-threats]] is on causes of [[climate-damage]]. [[climate-counteraction]] is actively hurting [[climate-action]], though distinguishing it from [[climate-inaction]] may be difficult and unnecessary. [[climate-action-driver|climate action drivers]] are the forces that drive [[climate-action]].

On climate-inaction-solution ideas. These are more climate-pathway-solutions, as they don't necessarily solve for inaction, but are the 'desired actions' to drive climate-action (in the literature so-far mostly economic), whose effectiveness may be questioned.

climate-action.economic.forces # what forces create positive and negative action?
climate-action.economic # list of economic climate action
Force is complicated to use, e.g. philanthropic.forces may indicate their actions instead of their drivers i.e. where the actor is causing influence instead of causes influencing the actor.

Green, climate-friendly, sustainable, [[climate-terminology]]

[[transition-risks]] are risks that occur from making the transition to a compatible-climate-future, are they the same as [[climate-threats]]?
