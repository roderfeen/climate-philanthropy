## In literature

### [[drollette2021]]

[[tom-steyer]] thinks the majority of famous, wealthy businessman (such as Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Hank Paulson, Jamie Dimon [CEO of JP Morgan]) have realised taking on climate change is something we absolutely have to do, which wasnt the case 10 years ago [2011, red.](@drollette2021, 74). Evidence of this according to [[tom-steyer]] is in "what they say, how things get valued in the marketplace and where the big money is going" [@drollette2021, 74].

### [[nisbet2018]]

Between 2011 and 2015, $556.7 million in grants were distributed to support activities at the Federal, state, and municipal levels related to climate change and energy in the United States[@nisbet2018, 6]. The [[energy-foundation]] (17%), [[hewlett-foundation]], [[kresge-foundation]], [[macarthur-foundation]] account for $288.8 million or 52% of the total [[climate-action]] philanthropic spending in the United States [@nisbet2018, 6]. 20 organisations received 41% of all funding (approx. $230.4 of $556.7 million) which is consistent with the critique that philanthropies favour [[inside-of-the-beltway]] strategies consisting of policy analysis, lobbying, and legal action [@bartosiewicz2013; @dowie2002; @jenkins2017; @nisbet2011] [@nisbet2018, 6-7].

[[matthew-nisbet]] identifies several grantmaking trends on in [[climate-philanthropy]] by the 19 selected [[philanthropies|foundation]] [@nisbet2018, 8-9]:

* Very few grants were dedicated to establishing a carbon tax or a cap and trade system.  
* A trend to fund carbon neutral cities and sustainable regional economies ($18.7 million)  
* Includes smart growth advocacy, sustainable housing communities, urban eco-districts, and sustainable development initiatives.  
* A trend to fund promoting urban, regional, or local [[climate-adaptation]] efforts ($17.2 million)  
* Includes urban planning groups, transportation, flood management, and coastal resilience  
* A significant portion went to East coast areas affected by Hurricane Sandy  
* A trend to fund state or municipal level activities aimed at promoting [[climate-justice]] on behalf of minority, indigenous, urban, rural, and low-income communities ($16.1 million).  
* Includes protecting the most vulnerable, creating economic opportunities, reducing [[climate-change]] related disparities among these communities.

[[matthew-nisbet]] identifies several areas of grantmaking amongst the 19 selected foundations, namely [@nisbet2018, 7-12]:
