Theory of Philanthropy

1) Altruism: Suggests that individuals engage in philanthropy primarily out of a desire to help others, without any expectation of personal gain or benefit.

2) Social capital: Suggests that philanthropy can help to build social networks and relationships, which can in turn lead to greater social cohesion, trust, and cooperation.

3) Public goods: Suggests that philanthropy can help to provide public goods that are undersupplied by the market or the government, such as education, healthcare, and environmental protection.

4) Social justice: Suggests that philanthropy can help to address systemic inequalities and injustices, particularly those related to race, gender, and socioeconomic status.
Effective altruism: Suggests that philanthropy should be focused on achieving the greatest possible impact, using evidence-based approaches to identify the most effective interventions and strategies.
