Climate change denial, or global warming denial, is denial, dismissal, or unwarranted doubt that contradicts the scientific consensus on climate change, including the extent to which it is caused by humans, its effects on nature and human society, or the potential of adaptation to global warming by human actions.[5][6][7] Many who deny, dismiss, or hold unwarranted doubt about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming self-label as "climate change skeptics",[8][6] which several scientists have noted is an inaccurate description.[9][10][11] Climate change denial can also be implicit when individuals or social groups accept the science but fail to come to terms with it or to translate their acceptance into action.[12] Several social science studies have analyzed these positions as forms of denial or denialism,[13][14] pseudoscience,[15] or propaganda.[16]
