## Definition

[[mark-carney]] identifies the [[tragedy-of-the-commons]] in [[environmental-economics]], meaning people use common goods for individual benefit while harming the collective. An example is a corporation overfishing for profit, leaving locals without a food source [@bloomberg2017, 10-11].
