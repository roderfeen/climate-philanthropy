An endowment fund is an investment portfolio with the initial capital deriving from donations. Endowment funds are established to fund charitable and nonprofit institutions such as churches, hospitals, and universities. Donations to endowment funds are tax-deductible. The Harvard University endowment is the largest academic endowment fund in the world, with a $40.9 billion asset under management as of 2019.
