### From [Briefing: What are Scope 3 emissions? | The Carbon Trust](https://www.carbontrust.com/resources/briefing-what-are-scope-3-emissions)

Greenhouse gas emissions are categorised into three groups or 'Scopes' by the most widely-used international accounting tool, the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. Scope 1 covers direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling consumed by the reporting company. Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions that occur in a companyâ€™s value chain.
