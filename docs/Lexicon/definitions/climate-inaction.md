## Concept

A lack of [[climate-action]], meant more passively, as opposed to the active form of [[climate-counteraction]].

## In scholarship

### [[bloomberg2017]]

Noted that climate inaction damage, climate change damage and [[climate-damage]] are the same thing since climate-change is man-made. The damage is due to inaction, even if it is by nature phenomena. And damage is (defined?) relative to us as humanity in a lot of cases.
