Not to be confused with the [[state]]

### From [State (polity) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity))

#### State and government

See also: [[government]]

A state can be distinguished from a government. The state is the organization while the government is the particular group of people, the administrative bureaucracy that controls the state apparatus at a given time.[41][42][43] That is, governments are the means through which state power is employed. States are served by a continuous succession of different governments.[43] States are immaterial and nonphysical social objects, whereas governments are groups of people with certain coercive powers.[44]

Each successive government is composed of a specialized and privileged body of individuals, who monopolize political decision-making, and are separated by status and organization from the population as a whole.
