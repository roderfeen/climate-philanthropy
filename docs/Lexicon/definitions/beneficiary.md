## Definition

### From: [beneficiary | Wex | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/beneficiary)

A beneficiary is an individual who receives benefits from a transaction via a contract (such as an insurance policy), a will, or trust.

Wills and Trusts:

A beneficiary is an individual named in a will, revocable trust, or irrevocable trust to receive property from a testator or grantor. A beneficiary is usually definitive, which is reasonably ascertained now or in the future. Natural persons, corporations, or other organizations like charities can all be beneficiaries. But the same person cannot be the sole trustee and sole beneficiary. The property includes real estate, personal property (e.g., art or jewelry collections, car, and books), financial assets (e.g., cash, bank accounts, and stocks), and so on.
