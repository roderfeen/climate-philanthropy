### From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_Beltway)

"Inside the Beltway" is an American idiom used to characterize matters that are, or seem to be, important primarily to officials of the U.S. federal government, to its contractors and lobbyists, and to the media personnel who cover them - as opposed to the interests and priorities of the general U.S. population.
