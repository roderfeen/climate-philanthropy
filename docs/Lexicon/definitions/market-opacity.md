## Definition

[[market-opacity]] is a type of [[market-failure]] by which unknown/inaccessible (market/financial) data hinders the decision making process of investors.

## In scholarship

### [[bloomberg2017]]

Which companies are most vulnerable to climate change? How big a financial impact might climate change have on a business and over what time frame? Which are best prepared? Which are taking action, and which are doing nothing? It is currently difficult or impossible for investors to answer those questions. Thatâ€™s a market failure. Transparency makes markets more efficient by allowing investors to value companies more accurately. The less transparency there is, the more companies are overvalued and undervalued, and the harder it is to allocate resources to maximize returns.
