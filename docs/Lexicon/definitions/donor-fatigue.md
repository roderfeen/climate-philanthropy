### From [Donor fatigue - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donor_fatigue)

Donor fatigue is a phenomenon in which people no longer donate to charities, although they have in the past.[1] On a larger scale, it can also refer to a slowness to act on the part of the international community or any other donor base in response to a humanitarian crisis or call-to-action.
