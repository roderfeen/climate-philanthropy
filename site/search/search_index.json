However, he rejects the control of population growth [neo-malthusian, ed.] and any control over the distribution of resources as incompatible with individual liberty, instead favoring supply-side control: more efficient production and curbs on overproduction and overexploitation.

A price on carbon helps shift the burden for the damage from GHG emissions back to those who are responsible for it and who can avoid it. Instead of dictating who should reduce emissions where and how, a carbon price provides an economic signal to emitters, and allows them to decide to either transform their activities and lower their emissions, or continue emitting and paying for their emissions. In this way, the overall environmental goal is achieved in the most flexible and least-cost way to society. Placing an adequate price on GHG emissions is of fundamental relevance to internalize the external cost of climate change in the broadest possible range of economic decision making and in setting economic incentives for clean development. It can help to mobilize the financial investments required to stimulate clean technology and market innovation, fueling new, low-carbon drivers of economic growth.</p>"},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/central-banks/","title":"central-banks","text":"<p>2022-08-21 20:33:33 Origin: [[bloomberg2017]]</p>"},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/central-banks/#definition","title":"Definition","text":""},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/ceo/","title":"ceo","text":"<p>2022-08-22 10:56:55 Origin: [[bloomberg2017]]</p>"},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/ceo/#definition","title":"Definition","text":""},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/charitable-corporation/","title":"charitable-corporation","text":"<p>2022-09-13 20:10:58 Origin: [[sarang2016]] </p>"},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/charitable-corporation/#definition","title":"Definition","text":""},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/charitable-trust/","title":"charitable-trust","text":"<p>2022-09-06 14:23:18 Origin: [[sarang2016]]</p>"},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/charitable-trust/#definition","title":"Definition","text":""},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/civil-society/","title":"civil-society","text":"<p>2022-09-29 16:27:52 Origin: [[morena2020]]</p>"},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/civil-society/#definition","title":"Definition","text":""},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/clean-energy-firms/","title":"clean-energy-firms","text":"<p>2022-09-15 16:16:36 Origin: [[sarang2016]] renewable-energy</p>"},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/clean-energy-firms/#definition","title":"Definition","text":""},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/climate-action-data/","title":"climate-action-data","text":"<p>2022-08-21 21:58:17 Origin: [[bloomberg2017]]</p>"},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/climate-action-data/#definition","title":"Definition","text":"<p>Data that is used to measure the climate-action-performance of an organisation.</p> <p>Could potentially also be called [[greening-data]], in case the climate-terminology is resolved to green as the main term to be used throughout the PhD.</p>"},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/climate-action-driver/","title":"climate-action-driver","text":"<p>2022-08-24 17:34:22 Origin: self, first used in [[pearce2019]]</p>"},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/climate-action-driver/#definition","title":"Definition","text":"<p>Force causing climate action, driving</p>"},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/climate-action-financial/","title":"climate-action-financial","text":"<p>2022-08-21 21:07:09 Origin: [[bloomberg2017]]</p>"},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/climate-action-financial/#definition","title":"Definition","text":"<p>Might be a list of examples that support the idea that [[climate-inaction-has-economic-solutions]]</p>"},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/climate-action-investments/","title":"climate-action-investments","text":"<p>2022-09-06 13:54:21 Origin: self climate-action</p>"},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/climate-action-investments/#definition","title":"Definition","text":"<p>Trying to get the constituents of value-investing ready.</p>"},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/climate-action-legal/","title":"climate-action-legal","text":"<p>2022-08-02 16:40:27 Origin: [[nisbet2018]]</p>"},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/climate-action-legal/#definition","title":"Definition","text":"<p>Probably will be a list of climate legislation.

In political theory, this concept is often used to critique the persistence of outdated or oppressive policies, laws, or cultural norms that were established by previous generations and continue to shape the present.</p> <p>The critique of the Dead Hand is rooted in the belief that societies and institutions must be able to adapt and evolve in response to changing circumstances and new information, rather than being held back by the traditions and beliefs of the past. When policies or cultural norms established by past generations continue to shape the present, they can perpetuate inequalities, reinforce discrimination, and impede progress.</p> <p>For example, critics of the Dead Hand might argue that outdated laws or policies that were designed to discriminate against certain groups, such as racial minorities or women, should be reevaluated and updated to reflect modern values of equality and inclusion. They might also argue that cultural practices or traditions that were established in the past should be reexamined and potentially revised if they are found to be harmful or incompatible with contemporary social norms.</p> <p>In essence, the critique of the Dead Hand is a call for societies and institutions to be forward-looking, open to change, and responsive to the needs and perspectives of current and future generations, rather than being beholden to the beliefs and values of the past.</p>"},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/debt-financier/","title":"debt-financier","text":"<p>2022-09-13 20:31:10 Origin: [[sarang2016]]</p>"},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/debt-financier/#definition","title":"Definition","text":""},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/divestment-movement/","title":"divestment-movement","text":"<p>2022-09-06 11:39:34 Origin: [[sarang2016]]</p>"},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/divestment-movement/#definition","title":"Definition","text":""},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/divestment/","title":"divestment","text":"<p>2022-08-02 17:16:47 Origin: [[nisbet2018]]</p>"},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/divestment/#definition","title":"Definition","text":""},{"location":"Lexicon/definitions/divestment/#from-divestment---wikipedia","title":"From Divestment - Wikipedia","text":"<p>In finance and economics, divestment or divestiture is the reduction of some kind of asset for financial, ethical, or political objectives or sale of an existing business by a firm.
